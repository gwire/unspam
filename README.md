# Unspam

Ultra simple tool to create postfix-compatible IP-blocklists based on AS-Numbers or IP-addresses. This is a very brutal way and should be limited to known spam providers.

## Installation

    $ gem install unspam

## Usage/Example

So you received another "Casino"-spam from e.g.

```
Received: from ab19c8d9.dutxng.net (171.25.200.217.static.clcksthrough.com [171.25.200.217]) by â€¦
```

After some research you come to the conclusion, that the ISP behind 171.25.200.217 looks like a spam hoster that sent you spam mails for years and don't react on abuse notifications. It's time to let it go!

All announed prefixes of that spam ISP will be looked up using the RIPE.net looking glass. Your optional message will apprear behind the net so you can easily paste/add this to your postfix client_checks file.

You can use an IP-Address or AS-number to lookup the result.

e.g.

```shell
unspam net AS31342
```

will produce the identical result.
