# Unspam

Ultra simple tool to create postfix-compatible IP-blocklists based on AS-Numbers or IP-addresses. This is a very brutal way and should be limited to known spam providers.

## Installation
    
Install Ruby 1.9.3+
then:

    $ gem install unspam

## Usage/Example

So you received another "Casino"-spam from e.g.

```
Received: from ab19c8d9.dutxng.net (171.25.200.217.static.clcksthrough.com [171.25.200.217]) by â€¦
```

After some research you come to the conclusion, that the ISP behind 171.25.200.217 looks like a spam hoster that sent you spam mails for years and don't react on abuse notifications. It's time to let it go!

```

All announed prefixes of that spam ISP will be looked up using the [RIPE.net RESTful looking glass](https://stat.ripe.net/docs/data_api). Your optional message will appear right behind the net so you can easily paste/add this to your postfix client_checks file or wrap some shell commands around it.

You can use an IP-Address or AS-number to lookup the result.

e.g.

```shell
$ unspam net AS31342
```

will produce the identical result.

## Tricks

To see all announced IP-networks of Amazon AWS, DigitalOcean and Hetzner, try:

```shell
$ unspam nets $( dig a +short amazonaws.com | head -n1 )
$ unspam nets $( dig a +short digitalocean.com | head -n1 )
$ unspam nets $( dig a +short hetzner.de | head -n1 )
```

Enjoy!
